Datastructure in Python:
    List : It is iterable can be modified, representation using []
    Tuples : It is iterable but cant be modified , represented using ()
    Dictionaries : It is key value pair,can be modified, represented using {}

Unpacking in python: ex numbers = [1,2,3]
                        x,y,z = numbers , it is applicable to list also
Function in python:
    - By default function will return None object
    -  We can have keyword arguement and default parameter in python
    - If we are mixing positonal arguement and keyworkd arguement then we should write postional arguement first followed by
        keyword arguement

Error handling:
    - Using try and except block
Comments:
    - # single line comment - shortcut ctrl+/

Class:
    - Class is the blueprint of the object
    - Object is the actuall instance of the class
    - ex className = ClassName()

Constructor:
    - ex: def _init_(self) using this we can initialize our object

Inheritance:
    - It is the mechanism to reuse the code
pass:
    - telling python interpretor to pass this line dont worry about this
